#  This configuration file sets up a single sink that uses the custom
# "JsonFile" destination provided by the library.  This destination can
# be configured the same way as the "TextFile" destination provided by
#  Boost.Log, except the "RotationInterval", "RotationTimePoint", and
# "Format" settings are not available.
